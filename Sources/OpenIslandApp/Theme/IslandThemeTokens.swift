/// `IslandChromeMetrics` and `IslandPanelView` gets expressed once here, and
/// views read it from the environment via `@Environment(\.islandTokens)`.
///
/// Deliberately split three ways so a theme can override one axis without
/// restating the others. Typography is intentionally absent: themes swap
/// entire slot views, so per-view fonts belong to each theme's own views
/// rather than to a shared token table.
///
/// Not `Codable` — `Color` has no stable `Codable` conformance and
/// `IslandAnimationToken` is a rendering concern, not persisted state. Themes
/// are selected by identifier; the tokens themselves are code, not data.
