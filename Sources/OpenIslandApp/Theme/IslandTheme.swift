/// A complete visual identity for the island overlay.
///
/// The theme-arch series (AB-293…298) moved styling into `IslandThemeTokens`,
/// routed every overlay surface through those tokens, formalized `RowActions`
/// and the hover container, and extracted the panel-shell surfaces into
/// standalone slot components. This protocol is the capstone (AB-299): it
/// gathers those tokens, the capability flags and grid strategy, and a factory
/// per slot into one type, so `IslandPanelView` composes the overlay purely
/// from `@Environment(\.islandTheme)` and never names a concrete component.
/// After this, a new theme is "implement the protocol + register it".
///
/// **Granularity.** The Scope for AB-299 lists the theme's slots more finely
/// than there are seams in the view tree — e.g. "sessions summary", "section
/// header" and "footer" are the three regions of the one `sessionList` slot,
/// and "approval / question / completion body" are the actionable bodies drawn
/// inside the one `sessionRow` slot. Each factory below therefore owns a group
/// of Scope slots, noted in its doc comment; a theme controls a bundled slot by
/// swapping the factory that renders it. The shared invariants that are *not*
/// theme-swappable (presentation/display rules, `RowActions` wiring, keyboard
/// shortcuts, hover container, accessibility gates, the attention-is-loudest
/// hierarchy) live in `SessionState` / `AgentSession+Presentation` / the slot
/// components and are documented in `docs/architecture.md`.
///
/// `@MainActor` because every factory builds SwiftUI views; the identity,
/// tokens and capability flags are read on the main actor too (overlay render,
/// panel sizing, Settings). Conformers are stateless value types, so they stay
/// `Sendable` and can be handed around freely.
